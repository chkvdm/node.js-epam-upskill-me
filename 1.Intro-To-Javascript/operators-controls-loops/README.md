# Operators and Controls. Loops

## Tasks

### Arrays difference

Create a JavaScript function to find difference between two arrays.
For example:

```js
arrayDiff([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // result: [4, 5]
arrayDiff(["a", "b", "c"], ["a", "b"]); // result: ['c']
```

### Even Odd checker

Create a JavaScript function which gets two numbers and iterates over them. Check if it is even or odd.
For example:

```js
evenOrOdd(0, 3); // result: ['0 is even', '1 is odd', '2 is even', '3 is odd']
evenOrOdd(2, 4); // result: ['2 is even', '3 is odd', '4 is even']
```

### Range sum

Create a JavaScript function to get a sum of all numbers in the given range.

For example:

```js
rangeSum(5, 10); // result: 45
rangeSum(0, 6); // result: 21
```

Write your code in `src/index.js.
_All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors._

## Prepare and test

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Fork this repository: operators-controls-loops
3. Clone your newly created repo: https://gitlab.com/<%your_gitlab_username%>/operators-controls-loops/
4. Go to folder `operators-controls-loops`
5. To install all dependencies use [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)
6. Run `npm test` in the command line
7. You will see the number of passing and failing tests
