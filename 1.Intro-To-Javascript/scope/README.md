# Scope

## Tasks

### Number generator

Create function "createCounter" to generate numbers. It should receive the start value, which by default is equal to 0.

For example:

```js
const counter = createCounter(44);
counter(); // 45
counter(); // 46
counter(); // 47
```

### Multiply

Create function "multiply" to multiple values as shown below.

For example:

```js
multiply(2)(4)(6); // 48
multiply(3)(3)(3); // 27
```

Write your code in `src/index.js.
_All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors._

## Prepare and test

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Fork this repository: scope
3. Clone your newly created repo: https://gitlab.com/<%your_gitlab_username%>/scope/
4. Go to folder `scope`
5. To install all dependencies use [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)
6. Run `npm test` or `npm run test:local` in the command line
7. You will see the number of passing and failing tests
