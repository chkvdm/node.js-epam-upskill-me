# EPAM UpSkillMe_Node.js program.

The EPAM Upskill Me Node.js program covers JavaScript fundamentals, including variables, data types, operators, controls, and loops. The program delves into functions, scope, prototypes, class syntax, and ES6 features, while also covering asynchronous programming techniques using callbacks, promises, and async/await functions. Practical experience with Node.js is gained through building HTTP servers, and CLI applications, and utilizing the Express framework for RESTful APIs. The curriculum also includes knowledge of NoSQL and SQL databases such as MongoDB, Redis, and MySQL, as well as an introduction to GraphQL. Testing and debugging are covered using Mocha, Chai, and Jest frameworks. Also, TypeScript basics, including types, interfaces, classes, generics, modules, and decorators, are taught for building Node.js applications.

## Program consists of following courses:

1. <code>[JavaScript Basics](https://github.com/chkvdm/node.js-epam-upskill-me/tree/main/1.Intro-To-Javascript)</code>.
The repository contains tasks and solutions for the "JavaScript Basics and Advanced Concepts" course. It covers fundamental JavaScript concepts such as variables, data types, operators, controls, and loops. Advanced topics include functions, scope, prototypes, and prototypes inheritance. The course also explores class syntax and ES6 features. It provides practical experience in handling async programming through tasks involving callbacks, promises, and async/await functions. Additionally, it offers guidance on project setup and dependency management using NPM.
2. <code>[Node.js Baseline](https://github.com/chkvdm/node.js-epam-upskill-me/tree/main/2.Node.js-Baseline)</code>.
The repository contains tasks and solutions from the Node.js Baseline course, which provides knowledge and practical experience with essential Node.js concepts. The course covers the fundamentals of Node.js, including its functionality and the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous code execution. It also explores the utilization of Node.js to construct a basic HTTP server and a Command Line Interface (CLI) application.
3. <code>[Node.js and Express](https://github.com/chkvdm/node.js-epam-upskill-me/tree/main/3.Node.js-and-Express.js)</code>.
The repository contains tasks and solutions from the "Express.js Web Development" course. This course focuses on the Express framework. It covers the fundamental building blocks of Express and explores the concept of middleware. Throughout the course, you will develop applications using this framework.
4. <code>[Databases and GraphQL](https://github.com/chkvdm/node.js-epam-upskill-me/tree/main/4.Databases-and-GraphQL)</code>.
The repository contains tasks and solutions from the Databases and GraphQL course. The course covers the distinctions between NoSQL and SQL databases. Inside the repository, you can find an implementation of a minimalistic TODO app using MongoDB and MySQL. Additionally, there is an implementation that utilizes GraphQL based on MySQL.
5. <code>[Code Quality and Testing](https://github.com/chkvdm/node.js-epam-upskill-me/tree/main/5.Code-Quality-and-Testing)</code>.
The repository contains tasks and solutions for a comprehensive course that covers a wide range of tests, including unit tests and functional tests. This course equips with the essential knowledge and hands-on experience to effectively utilize Mocha and Chai for writing unit and function tests specifically tailored for Node.js applications. Additionally, it provides valuable insights into debugging and profiling Node.js applications, as well as familiarizing with benchmarking tools.
6. <code>[Typescript for Node.js](https://github.com/chkvdm/node.js-epam-upskill-me/tree/main/6.TypeScript)</code>.
The repository comprises tasks and solutions for a course that covers the foundations of TypeScript programming. This course introduces to TypeScript and provides an understanding of its core concepts and functionality. The course materials encompass the fundamental building blocks of TypeScript, such as types, interfaces, classes, generics, modules, and decorators. The course emphasizes the benefits of type safety and demonstrates how to leverage them effectively to develop robust programs. Furthermore, the course gives understanding insights into utilizing TypeScript for building Node.js apps and sense the rationale behind the integration of TypeScript into modern development workflows.
