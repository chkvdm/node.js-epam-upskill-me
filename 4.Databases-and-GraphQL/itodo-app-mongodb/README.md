# iTODO app endpoint implementation

This is a simple task list management application.
To access the list of tasks, you must register and log in to the application. After that, you get access to your task list.
Using endpoint calls, you can create an actual task and add it to the TODO list. The list of active tasks is available in the "TODO" section.
You can change the status of a task by marking it with a marker. The completed task is moved to the DONE list. You can also update the task title and description, or delete it entirely.
